\title{Perform cross-validation of merged gene expression data.}
\usage{
metapredictCv(ematMerged, sampleMetadata, weights, alpha, nFolds = 10,
  foldid = NA, nRepeats = 3, yName = "class",
  addlFeatureColnames = NA, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ematMerged}{matrix of gene expression for genes by samples.}

\item{sampleMetadata}{data.frame of sample metadata,
with rownames corresponding to sample names.}

\item{weights}{vector of weights.}

\item{alpha}{vector of values for alpha, the elastic net mixing parameter.}

\item{nFolds}{number of folds. Ignored, if foldid is not NA.}

\item{foldid}{vector of values specifying what fold each observation is in.}

\item{nRepeats}{number of times to perform cross-validation. Ignored, if foldid is not NA.}

\item{yName}{column in sampleMetadata containing values of the response variable.}

\item{addlFeatureColnames}{optional vector of column names containing other features
to be used for predicting the response variable.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to cv.glmnet.}
}
\value{
A list of cv.glmnet objects.
}
\description{
\code{metapredictCv} runs cross-validation to predict a
	response variable from gene expression data across multiple
	studies. This function is a wrapper around cv.glmnet.
